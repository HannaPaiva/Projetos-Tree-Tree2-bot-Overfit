## How to set up

To set up the bot I made it as simple as possible. I now created a [config.yaml](config.yaml) file where you can put the
needed things to edit.

Here is an explanation of what everything is:

| Variable              | What it is                                                            |
| ----------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TOKEN                 | You insert the token of your bot                                      |
